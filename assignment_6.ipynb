    "# Question 1\n",
    "OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING:\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data, in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures. A feature of objects is an object's procedures that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated.\n",
    "There are 4 major principles that make an language Object Oriented. These are,\n",
    "1. Encapsulation\n",
    "2. Data Abstraction\n",
    "3. Polymorphism\n",
    "4. Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 2\n",
    "Benefits of OOPS\n",
    "1. Object oriented system can easily be upgraded from small to large system\n",
    "2. Code reude is possible\n",
    "3. It provides principle of data hiding helps for security\n",
    "4. It is easy to partition the work in a project based on objects.\n",
    "5. Encapsulation, improved software maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Function\n",
    "Function is block of code that is also called by its name. (independent)\n",
    "The function can have different parameters or may not have any at all. If any data (parameters) are passed, they are passed explicitly.\n",
    "It may or may not return any data.\n",
    "Function does not deal with Class and its instance concept\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Method\n",
    "Method is called by its name, but it is associated to an object (dependent).\n",
    "A method is implicitly passed the object on which it is invoked.\n",
    "It may or may not return any data.\n",
    "A method can operate on the data (instance variables) that is contained by the corresponding class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 4\n",
    "1. Class :\n",
    "        Class is a model or blueprint(map) of anything. It may be defined as something that can be followed to create objects and instances. It is a code template for creating object having same behaviours.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Object:\n",
    "        Object is a collection of data and methods that act on those data and it follows all the requirements of the class to which it is belonged\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Attributes:\n",
    "        The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Behaviour:\n",
    "        The behavior of an object is defined by its methods, which are the functions and subroutines defined within the object class. Without class methods, a class would simply be a structure. Methods determine what type of functionality a class has, how it modifies its data, and its overall behavior.\n",
